                <li>The Treelo page has three main and important components: the Tree View, Tree Navigation Sidebar, the
                    Members Sidebar, and the Context Menu.
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>Tree View: The Tree View is the main focus of the Treelo page. It displays each tree you
                            have
                            created one tree at a time.&nbsp;

                        </li>

                        <li>Tree Navigation Sidebar: The Navigation Sidebar can be opened by clicking the Treelo Menu
                            button
                            shown below. 
                            <img src="images/TreeNav.png" alt="The Tree View Side Navigation Bar" width="100%">
                            This sidebar will have buttons corresponding to all of the trees you have
                            created
                            and have access to. It also contains the options to logout, create a new tree, and view this
                            quickstart guide.

                        </li>
                        <li>Members Sidebar: You can open the members sidebar clicking the Members button as shown below.
                            <img src="images/OpenShareNav.png" alt="The Tree View Side Navigation Bar" width="100%">
                            The members sidebar contains all of the shared views for the current tree
                            that
                            you are viewing. Simply put, this means that when you share any portion of a tree with an
                            individual, a button will appear here which, when clicked, will show you what view the
                            person
                            that you shared with can see.&nbsp;

                        </li>
                        <li>The Context Menu is not present until a node within a tree is right-clicked. This action
                            opens
                            the menu and from there there are many options. These include adding a card, deleting a
                            card,
                            sharing a tree, and setting a card as the focus node.&nbsp;

                            <img src="images/CreateTree.png" alt="The Tree View Side Navigation Bar" width="100%">
                            This opens a popup for creating a new tree. Fill out the information for both the

                                <li>You have many options when it comes to editing your newly created trees. Firstly,
                                    you
                                    can add nodes by right clicking on the node you wish to add a node from. This will

                                    the <strong>Context Menu</strong> as described above in the Navigation section of

                                    will be deleted.

                                    at which you shared from. They will not have access to higher level parent nodes

                                    This will make the selected node appear to be the root node, thus 'zooming' in on a
                                    section of the tree for better, clearer viewing.
