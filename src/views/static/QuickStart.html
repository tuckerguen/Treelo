<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welome to Treelo, the tree based organizational software!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting started:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>Navigation
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>The Treelo page has three main and important components: the Tree View, Tree Navigation Sidebar, the
                Members Sidebar, and the Context Menu.
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>Tree View: The Tree View is the main focus of the Treelo page. It displays each tree you have
                        created one tree at a time.&nbsp;
                        <img src="images/TreeView.png" alt="The Tree View Side Navigation Bar" width="100%">
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>Tree Navigation Sidebar: The Navigation Sidebar can be opened by clicking the Treelo Menu button
                        shown below. This sidebar will have buttons corresponding to all of the trees you have created
                        and have access to. It also contains the options to logout, create a new tree, and view this
                        quickstart guide.</li>
                    <li>Members Sidebar: The members sidebar contains all of the shared views for the current tree that
                        you are viewing. Simply put, this means that when you share any portion of a tree with an
                        individual, a button will appear here which, when clicked, will show you what view the person
                        that you shared with can see.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The Context Menu is not present until a node within a tree is right-clicked. This action opens
                        the menu and from there there are many options. These include adding a card, deleting a card,
                        sharing a tree, and setting a card as the focus node.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>Creating your first tree:
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>If you are new to Treelo, the first step is to create a tree. To do so navigate to the Treelo
                        Tree Navigation Bar and click the 'Create a Tree' button located at the bottom of the sidebar as
                        shown. This opens a popup for creating a new tree. Fill out the information for both the tree
                        title and description and hit&nbsp;<strong>submit.</strong> Note: if you do not fill out both
                        the title and description fields, the tree will not be created. To cancel creation of a tree,
                        simply hit the&nbsp;<strong>cancel&nbsp;</strong>button.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Adding Nodes:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                            <li>You have many options when it comes to editing your newly created trees. Firstly, you
                                can add nodes by right clicking on the node you wish to add a node from. This will open
                                the <strong>Context Menu</strong> as described above in the Navigation section of this
                                guide. From here you can click the&nbsp;<strong>Add Node</strong> button and a new node
                                will be added as the child of the selected node.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Deleting Nodes:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

                                the&nbsp;<strong>Delete Card</strong> button.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Note: if the node/card that you wish to delete is the root of the tree, the entire tree
                                will be deleted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sharing Trees:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                            <li>To share a tree from a certain point, simply open the context menu and click
                                the&nbsp;<strong>SHARE</strong> button. This will open the share popup which will prompt
                                you to input the email of the user which you want to share the tree with.
                                Hit&nbsp;<strong>submit&nbsp;</strong>to share the tree and&nbsp;<strong>cancel</strong>
                                to close the popup.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Note: the user that you shared the tree with will only be able to see/edit from the node
                                at which you shared from. They will not have access to higher level parent nodes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Setting a Node as the Focus:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                            <li>To set a node as the focus, to make the current node the root node for visual purposes,
                                simply open the Context Menu and click the&nbsp;<strong>Set Focus Node</strong> button.
                                This will make the selected node appear to be the root node, thus 'zooming' in on a
                                section of the tree for better, clearer viewing.</li>
                        </ul>
